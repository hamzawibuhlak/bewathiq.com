# Implementation Plan - Watheeq UI/UX Updates

## Goal Description
Address multiple user requests including updating the login page with company name and forgot password features, fixing 404/redirection errors on Call Center and Customer pages, and adding a QR code option to the WhatsApp integration page.

## User Review Required
- [ ] Confirmation on where the "Company Name" should be validated against (e.g., is it for multi-tenancy login?).
- [ ] Clarification on "API email tied to the application owner" - assuming this means using the system's configured SMTP settings dynamically based on the tenant/owner.

## Proposed Changes

### Frontend
#### Login Page
- Modify the login form to include a "Company Name" input field at the top.
- Add a "Forgot Password" link below the password field.
- Ensure the login payload includes the company name if required by backend.

#### Call Center Page
- Investigate routing configuration.
- Ensure the component exists and is correctly exported.

#### Customer Page
- Investigate routing and component existence to resolve 404.

#### WhatsApp Integration Page
- Add a visible option/tab for "Scan QR Code".
- Implement the UI for displaying the QR code (mock or real if API available).

### Backend
#### Auth Module
- Update login DTO to accept `companyName`.
- Implement `forgotPassword` endpoint if missing.
- Ensure email service uses the correct sender identity.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- None planned for this UI-heavy task, will rely on manual verification.

### Manual Verification
- **Login**: Try logging in with Company Name. Click "Forgot Password" and check if email is sent.
- **Call Center**: Click the link in navigation, verify page loads.
- **Customers**: Navigate to customers page, verify page loads.
- **WhatsApp**: Check for "Scan QR Code" option.
