  "summary": "Implementation plan for Phase 39 — Legal AI Search Engine. Builds on existing Phase 30 legal library infrastructure. Adds Anthropic Claude AI integration for intelligent legal Q&A, extends existing Prisma models with AI-specific fields, creates a new LegalAIService, and builds a premium Legal AI Search page. Uses existing CacheService for response caching instead of adding new Redis dependency. Defers Typesense and pgvector to future iterations in favor of PostgreSQL full-text search.",
